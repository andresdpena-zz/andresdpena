- 👋 Hi, I’m @andresdpena
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about web development and data science. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS and Javascript, which are basic tools for a front-end developer. 
However, I'd like to learn about both front-end and back-end development. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects that don't necessarily require lots of previous knowledge. 
- 📫 How to reach me ... through email at: andresd.pena@gmail.com or andres.david.pena@outlook.com
